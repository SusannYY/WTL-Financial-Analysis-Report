This is an independent project including data cleaning, messy and missing data handling, using Regex and NLP to manipulate string and perform cross dataset merges. Then, with a cleaned data, I calculated labor efficiency, profit efficiency, and productivity etc. evaluation metrics, and K means clustering to segment project based on size and revenue and labor work hours. In the end, I visualized the results and finished this report.
